## Overview

Cosmic Pressure and Containment (CPC) theory proposes that the structure and dynamics of the universe are governed not only by gravity but by a balance between internal cosmic pressure and an external containment field.

This approach challenges the traditional gravity-only model by explaining cosmic expansion, galaxy dynamics, and photon behavior through pressure effects.

## Key Points

- Universe expands due to increasing internal cosmic pressure pushing outward.
- External containment force balances internal pressure, maintaining cosmic structure.
- Explains redshift and cosmic microwave background uniformity differently.
- Predicts a catastrophic rupture if containment fails.
- Avoids singularities and dark energy hypotheses.
